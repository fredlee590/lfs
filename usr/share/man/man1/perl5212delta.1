.SH "NAME"
perl5212delta \- what is new for perl v5.21.2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.21.1 release and the 5.21.2
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.0, first read
perl5211delta, which describes differences between 5.21.0 and 5.21.1.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Better heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF8ness"
.IX Subsection "Better heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF8ness"
On platforms that implement neither the C99 standard nor the \s-1POSIX 2001\s0
standard, determining if the current locale is \s-1UTF8\s0 or not depends on
heuristics.  These are improved in this release.
.SH "Security"
.IX Header "Security"
.SS "Perl is now always compiled with \-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 if available"
.IX Subsection "Perl is now always compiled with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 if available"
The 'code hardening' option called \f(CW\*(C`_FORTIFY_SOURCE\*(C'\fR, available in
gcc 4.*, is now always used for compiling Perl, if available.
.PP
Note that this isn't necessarily a huge step since in many platforms
the step had already been taken several years ago: many Linux
distributions (like Fedora) have been using this option for Perl,
and \s-1OS X\s0 has enforced the same for many years.
.SH "Deprecations"

.ie n .SS """/\eC/"" character class"
.el .SS "\f(CW/\eC/\fP character class"
.IX Subsection "/C/ character class"
This character class, which matches a single byte, even if it appears
in a multi-byte character has been deprecated. Matching single bytes
in a multi-byte character breaks encapsulation, and can corrupt utf8
strings.

Experimental support for ops in the optree to be able to locate their
parent, if any. A general-purpose function, \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling_splice()\*(C'\fR
allows for general manipulating an \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR chain. The last op
in such a chain is now marked with the field \f(CW\*(C`op_lastsib\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
A new build define, \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR has been added; if
given, it forces the core to use \f(CW\*(C`op_lastsib\*(C'\fR to detect the
last sibling in a chain, freeing the last \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR pointer,
which then points back to the parent (instead of being \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
A C\-level \f(CW\*(C`op_parent()\*(C'\fR function, and a \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`parent()\*(C'\fR method
have been added; under a default build, they return \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR, but when
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR has been set, they return the parent of the current op.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
