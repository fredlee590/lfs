Perl 5.21.2 introduced a new build option, \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR, which causes
the last \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR pointer to refer back to the parent rather than being
\&\f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR, and where instead a new flag indicates the end of the chain.  In this
release, the new implementation has been revised; in particular:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
On \f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR builds, the \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR field has been renamed
\&\f(CW\*(C`op_sibparent\*(C'\fR to reflect its new dual purpose.  Since the intention is that
this field should primarily be accessed via macros, this change should be
transparent for code written to work under \f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The newly-introduced \f(CW\*(C`op_lastsib\*(C'\fR flag bit has been renamed \f(CW\*(C`op_moresib\*(C'\fR and
its logic inverted; i.e. it is initialised to zero in a new op, and is changed
to 1 when an op gains a sibling.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The function \f(CW\*(C`Perl_op_parent\*(C'\fR is now only available on \f(CW\*(C`PERL_OP_PARENT\*(C'\fR
builds.  Using it on a plain build will be a compile-timer error.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Three new macros, \f(CW\*(C`OpMORESIB_set\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`OpLASTSIB_set\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`OpMAYBESIB_set\*(C'\fR have
been added, which are intended to be a low-level portable way to set
\&\f(CW\*(C`op_sibling\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`op_sibparent\*(C'\fR while also updating \f(CW\*(C`op_moresib\*(C'\fR.  The first
sets the sibling pointer to a new sibling, the second makes the op the last
sibling, and the third conditionally does the first or second action.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`op_sibling_splice()\*(C'\fR function is retained as a higher-level interface that
can also maintain consistency in the parent at the same time (e.g. by updating
\&\f(CW\*(C`op_first\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`op_last\*(C'\fR where appropriate).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The macro \f(CW\*(C`OpSIBLING_set\*(C'\fR, added in Perl 5.21.2, has been removed.  It didn't
manipulate \f(CW\*(C`op_moresib\*(C'\fR and has been superseded by \f(CW\*(C`OpMORESIB_set\*(C'\fR et al.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`op_sibling_splice\*(C'\fR function now accepts a null \f(CW\*(C`parent\*(C'\fR argument where
the splicing doesn't affect the first or last ops in the sibling chain, and
thus where the parent doesn't need to be updated accordingly.

\&\f(CW\*(C`pack("D", $x)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pack("F", $x)\*(C'\fR now zero the padding on x86 long double

the zero-initialized padding, or bypass the initialized buffer entirely.  This
caused \fIop/pack.t\fR to fail.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
