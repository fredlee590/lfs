This experimental feature allows set operations in regular expression patterns.
Prior to this, the intersection operator had the same precedence as the other
binary operators.  Now it has higher precedence.  This could lead to different
outcomes than existing code expects (though the documentation has always noted
that this change might happen, recommending fully parenthesizing the
expressions).  See \*(L"Extended Bracketed Character Classes\*(R" in perlrecharclass.

Core perl now works on this \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platform.  Early perls also worked, but,
even though support wasn't officially withdrawn, recent perls would not compile
and run well.  Perl 5.20 would work, but had many bugs which have now been
fixed.  Many \s-1CPAN\s0 modules that ship with Perl still fail tests, including
Pod::Simple.  However the version of Pod::Simple currently on \s-1CPAN\s0 should work;
it was fixed too late to include in Perl 5.22.  Work is under way to fix many
of the still-broken \s-1CPAN\s0 modules, which likely will be installed on \s-1CPAN\s0 when
completed, so that you may not have to wait until Perl 5.24 to get a working
version.

https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
