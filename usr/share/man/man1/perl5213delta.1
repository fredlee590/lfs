.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.21.2 release and the 5.21.3
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.1, first read
perl5212delta, which describes differences between 5.21.1 and 5.21.2.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Hexadecimal float: internal error
.Sp
(F) Something went horribly bad in hexadecimal float handling.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Hexadecimal float: unsupported long double format
.Sp
(F) You have configured Perl to use long doubles but
the internals of the long double format are unknown,
therefore the hexadecimal float output is impossible.
.PP
\fINew Warnings\fR
.IX Subsection "New Warnings"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Hexadecimal float: exponent overflow
.Sp
(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point has larger exponent
than the floating point supports.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Hexadecimal float: exponent underflow
.Sp
(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point has smaller exponent
than the floating point supports.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Hexadecimal float: mantissa overflow
.Sp
(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point literal had more bits in
the mantissa (the part between the 0x and the exponent, also known as
the fraction or the significand) than the floating point supports.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Hexadecimal float: precision loss
.Sp
(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point had internally more
digits than could be output.  This can be caused by unsupported
long double formats, or by 64\-bit integers not being available
(needed to retrieve the digits under some configurations).

.SH "Internal Changes"
.IX Header "Internal Changes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Added \*(L"sync_locale\*(R" in perlapi.
Changing the program's locale should be avoided by \s-1XS\s0 code.  Nevertheless,
certain non-Perl libraries called from \s-1XS,\s0 such as \f(CW\*(C`Gtk\*(C'\fR do so.  When this
happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has changed.  Use this function
to do so, before returning to Perl.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Added \*(L"grok_atou\*(R" in perlapi as a safer replacement for atoi and strtol.
.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Failing to compile \f(CW\*(C`use Foo\*(C'\fR in an eval could leave a spurious
\&\f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR subroutine definition, which would produce a \*(L"Subroutine
\&\s-1BEGIN\s0 redefined\*(R" warning on the next use of \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR, or other \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR
block.  [perl #122107]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`method { BLOCK } ARGS\*(C'\fR syntax now correctly parses the arguments if they
begin with an opening brace.  [perl #46947]
.IP "\(bu" 4
External libraries and Perl may have different ideas of what the locale is.
This is problematic when parsing version strings if the locale's numeric
separator has been changed.  Version parsing has been patched to ensure
it handles the locales correctly.  [perl #121930]
.IP "\(bu" 4
A bug has been fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks inside of a
regex could cause \f(CW\*(C`pos\*(C'\fR to see an incorrect value.  [perl #122460]

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0
