.SH "NAME"
perl5218delta \- what is new for perl v5.21.8
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.21.7 release and the 5.21.8
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.6, first read
perl5217delta, which describes differences between 5.21.6 and 5.21.7.
.SH "Notice"

.ie n .SS "The warnings pragma now supports warnings outside of ""all"""
.el .SS "The warnings pragma now supports warnings outside of ``all''"
.IX Subsection "The warnings pragma now supports warnings outside of all"
Ever since perl v5.6.0 we've had no way of adding new warnings without
retroactively adding them to all existing programs that used \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-W\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use warnings\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This caused us to not add new useful warnings out of fear that they
might unduly burden users who just wanted to upgrade perl and didn't
want to deal with a bunch of warnings from their existing code.
.PP
We now support a way to have our cake and eat it too, and can add new
warnings to the core going forward through other top-level warning
categories. See the warnings documentation for details.
.SS "Non-Capturing Regular Expression Flag"
.IX Subsection "Non-Capturing Regular Expression Flag"
Regular expressions now support a \f(CW\*(C`/n\*(C'\fR flag that disables capturing
and filling in \f(CW$1\fR, \f(CW$2\fR, etc... inside of groups:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  "hello" =~ /(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set
.Ve
.PP
This is equivalent to putting \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR at the beginning of every capturing group.
.PP
See \*(L"n\*(R" in perlre for more information.

.ie n .SS """use re \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq"""
.el .SS "\f(CWuse re \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\fP"
.IX Subsection "use re strict"
This applies stricter syntax rules to regular expression patterns
compiled within its scope, which hopefully will alert you to typos and
other unintentional behavior that backwards-compatibility issues prevent
us from doing in normal regular expression compilations.  Because the
behavior of this is subject to change in future Perl releases as we gain
experience, using this pragma will raise a category
\&\f(CW\*(C`experimental:re_strict\*(C'\fR warning.
See 'strict' in re.
.ie n .SS "New ""const"" subroutine attribute"
.el .SS "New ``const'' subroutine attribute"
.IX Subsection "New const subroutine attribute"
The \*(L"const\*(R" attribute can be applied to an anonymous subroutine.  It causes
it to be executed immediately when it is cloned.  Its value is captured and
used to create a new constant subroutine that is returned.  This feature is
experimental.  See \*(L"Constant Functions\*(R" in perlsub.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"

warning, but only turned on by the top-level \*(L"pedantic\*(R" warning
category, used for e.g. \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR in void context, which may indicate a
bug, but could also just be someone using \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR for its side-effects
as a loop.

Enabled as part of \*(L"extra\*(R" warnings, not in the \*(L"all\*(R" category. See

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\*(L"use re 'strict'\*(R" is experimental
.Sp
(S experimental::re_strict) The things that are different when a regular
expression pattern is compiled under \f(CW\*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\fR are subject to change
in future Perl releases in incompatible ways.  This means that a pattern
that compiles today may not in a future Perl release.  This warning is
to alert you to that risk.
.Sp
Wide character (U+%X) in \f(CW%s\fR
.Sp
(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (\fIi.e.\fR, a non\-UTF\-8
one), a multi-byte character was encountered.   Perl considers this
character to be the specified Unicode code point.  Combining non\-UTF8
locales and Unicode is dangerous.  Almost certainly some characters
will have two different representations.  For example, in the \s-1ISO 8859\-7
\&\s0(Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma.  But so
also does 0x393.  This will make string comparisons unreliable.
.Sp
You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up
with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a \s-1UTF\-8\s0
locale, but Perl disagrees).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Both or neither range ends should be Unicode in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/
.Sp
(W regexp) (only under \f(CW\*(C`use\ re\ \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\*(C'\fR or within \f(CW\*(C`(?[...])\*(C'\fR)
.Sp
In a bracketed character class in a regular expression pattern, you
had a range which has exactly one end of it specified using \f(CW\*(C`\eN{}\*(C'\fR, and
the other end is specified using a non-portable mechanism.  Perl treats
the range as a Unicode range, that is, all the characters in it are
considered to be the Unicode characters, and which may be different code
points on some platforms Perl runs on.  For example, \f(CW\*(C`[\eN{U+06}\-\ex08]\*(C'\fR
is treated as if you had instead said \f(CW\*(C`[\eN{U+06}\-\eN{U+08}]\*(C'\fR, that is it
matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are 6, 7, and 8.
But that \f(CW\*(C`\ex08\*(C'\fR might indicate that you meant something different, so
the warning gets raised.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Ranges of \s-1ASCII\s0 printables should be some subset of \*(L"0\-9\*(R", \*(L"A\-Z\*(R", or \*(L"a\-z\*(R" in regex; marked by <\-\- \s-1HERE\s0 in m/%s/

.Sp
Stricter rules help to find typos and other errors.  Perhaps you didn't
even intend a range here, if the \f(CW"\-"\fR was meant to be some other
character, or should have been escaped (like \f(CW"\e\-"\fR).  If you did
intend a range, the one that was used is not portable between \s-1ASCII\s0 and
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms, and doesn't have an obvious meaning to a casual
reader.

(You can force portability by specifying a Unicode range, which means that
the endpoints are specified by
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{...}\*(C'\fR, but the meaning may
still not be obvious.)
The stricter rules require that ranges that start or stop with an \s-1ASCII\s0
character that is not a control have all their endpoints be the literal
character, and not some escape sequence (like \f(CW"\ex41"\fR), and the ranges
must be all digits, or all uppercase letters, or all lowercase letters.

Stricter rules help to find typos and other errors.  You included a

Function either returns an \s-1SV\s0 * of type \s-1AV,\s0 which contains the set of
weakreferences which reference the passed in \s-1SV,\s0 or a simple \s-1RV\s0 * which
is the only weakref to this item.

A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and
other crashes has been fixed.  This occurred only in patterns compiled
with \f(CW"/i"\fR, while taking into account the current \s-1POSIX\s0 locale (this usually
means they have to be compiled within the scope of \f(CW"use\ locale"\fR),
and there must be a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match.
[perl #123539]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`s///\*(C'\fR now works on very long strings instead of dying with 'Substitution
loop'.  [perl #103260] [perl #123071]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR no longer crashes with not-a-number values.  [perl #123495]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e()\*(C'\fR (reference to an empty list) and \f(CW\*(C`y///\*(C'\fR with lexical \f(CW$_\fR in scope
could do a bad write past the end of the stack.  They have been fixed
to extend the stack first.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`prototype()\*(C'\fR with no arguments used to read the previous item on the
stack, so \f(CW\*(C`print "foo", prototype()\*(C'\fR would print foo's prototype.  It has
been fixed to infer \f(CW$_\fR instead.  [perl #123514]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some cases of lexical state subs inside predeclared subs could crash but no
longer do.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Some cases of nested lexical state subs inside anonymous subs could cause
\&'Bizarre copy' errors or possibly even crash.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When trying to emit warnings, perl's default debugger (\fIperl5db.pl\fR) was
sometimes giving 'Undefined subroutine &DB::db_warn called' instead.  This
bug, which started to occur in Perl 5.18, has been fixed.  [perl #123553]
.IP "\(bu" 4
Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as \f(CW\*(C`s/${<>{})//\*(C'\fR, would
crash, and had done so since Perl 5.10.  (In some cases the crash did not
start happening till 5.16.)  The crash has, of course, been fixed.
[perl #123542]
.IP "\(bu" 4
A repeat expression like \f(CW\*(C`33 x ~3\*(C'\fR could cause a large buffer
overflow since the new output buffer size was not correctly handled by
\&\fISvGROW()\fR.  An expression like this now properly produces a memory wrap
panic.  [perl 123554]
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`formline("@...", "a");\*(C'\fR would crash.  The \f(CW\*(C`FF_CHECKNL\*(C'\fR case in
\&\fIpp_formline()\fR didn't set the pointer used to mark the chop position,
which led to the \f(CW\*(C`FF_MORE\*(C'\fR case crashing with a segmentation fault.
This has been fixed.  [perl #123538]
.IP "\(bu" 4
A possible buffer overrun and crash when parsing a literal pattern during
regular expression compilation has been fixed.  [perl #123604]

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0
